    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>These are a particular favorite of my brother, who is always disappointed when the holiday season is over and candied cherries are not available anymore</p>
    <p>These cookes are easy to make but can brighten up any cookie platter. We reccomend using Betty Crocker's sugar cookie mix for best results however if you feel ambitious you can make your own sugar cookiee dough! Just make sure that the dough is designed for roll out cookies as we will be manipulating it quite a bit.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pkg. sugar cookie mix</li>
        <li>36-40 candied cherries</li>
        <li>additional flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare cookie mix according to the package, adding a few tablespoons of additional flour for the roll out cookie option usually on the package.</li>
        <li>Shape a thin layer of dough around each candied cherry</li>
        <li>Place 2 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet</li>
        <li>Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 minutes or until set <strong>but not browned</strong></li>
        <li>Remove from cookie sheet and cool completely</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><em>Optional: Chocolate Drizzle</em></h4>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 tsp. shortener <em>not butter</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chocolate chips and shortening in a small reasable plastic bag</li>
        <li>Place in hot watter or microwave for a few seconds at a time</li>
        <li>Dray bag and knead until well blended, reheating if necessary to get all chips melted</li>
        <li>Snip a tiny corner off of the dry bag and squeeze chocolate out to drizzle over cookies</li>
        <li>Allow chocolate to set before storing between layers of waxed paper in an airtight bag</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Using a spoon or  fork works just as well for drizzling!</p>
