        <p>These cookies are known in my family as "eggnog cookies" due to the fact that they taste exactly like eggnog. A glorious mix of nutmeg and rum flavouring will leave you thinking about Christmas everytime you eat these cookies.</p>
        <p>These cookies are even a favorite of my father's - and considering he doesn't like sweets, that's high praise! While I typically prefer these cookies iced, you can make them without the icing if you want an slightly less sweet version of the treat.</p>
